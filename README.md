# MIPS-Simulation
Mini processor simulator called SPIM using the C programming language. SPIM  demonstrates functions of the MIPS processor as well as the principle actions of the datapath and the control signals of a MIPS processor. The simulator reads in a file containing MIPS machine codes and simulate what the MIPS processor does cycle-by-cycle.
